# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
Tool: ChatGPT
Throughout the WeatherWise project, I used ChatGPT (GPT-4) extensively to assist with code generation, debugging, design decisions, and iterative improvements. The AI helped me structure my notebook using a modular, well-documented format, and provided real-time explanations of Python functions, edge case handling, and error management strategies. I also used it to simulate natural language interactions and improve user experience with input validation, fuzzy matching, and robust error handling.

## Prompting Techniques
I intentionally applied several prompting techniques from the project guidelines:

Restating the problem – I clarified the project requirements in my own words to check understanding and ensure alignment with scope.

Identifying input/output requirements – I asked the AI to help define the expected parameters and return values for key functions.

Requesting pseudocode – Before implementing complex logic like generate_weather_response(), I asked for pseudocode to visualise the design.

Challenging edge cases – I tested failure modes (e.g., invalid cities or API outages) and requested code revisions to gracefully handle them.

Requesting iterative improvements – I refined several features (e.g., precipitation parsing, moon phase integration) through follow-up prompts.

Querying design trade-offs – I explored the pros/cons of different implementation options (dashboard vs. chatbot vs. hybrid).

Requesting code explanations – I asked for in-line comments to ensure I fully understood each function and design pattern used.

## What Worked Well?
I am proud that i was able to get it to work, including the fuzzy location validation feature.

## What Would You Do Differently?
If I had more time, I would explore external API fallback options, such as integrating OpenWeatherMap or a second weather provide

## Final Thoughts
Rather than using the AI to just try do it for me, I learned how to guide its output with clear, strategic prompts. This led to higher quality code, better design decisions, and a stronger final product. The experience has really shown how valuable AI can be when paired with critical thinking and active engagement.
