Conversation about error handling and edge case testing

Me: What if the weather API returns bad data or the user inputs gibberish?

AI: Good point. You need:
- Try/except around API calls
- Check for 404 or bad responses
- Validate response schema
- Use fallback messaging like “Sorry, I couldn’t get the weather.”

Me: I also want to test an invalid location like “asdfgh” and make sure the app doesn't crash.

AI: Here's a good test block:

```
data = get_weather_data("asdfgh", forecast_days=3)
if data is None:
    print("✅ Passed: Invalid input handled safely.")
else:
    print("❌ Unexpected data returned.")
```
