Conversation about improving user experience and location validation

Me: I want my app to handle misspelled cities like "Brizban". Can it guess the closest match?

AI: Yes, use fuzzy matching with `rapidfuzz.process.extractOne()`:
- Maintain a list of known cities
- If API fails, suggest a close match
- Prompt user to confirm or retry

Me: Great. Weâ€™ll try that.

AI: Here's an implementation:

```
from rapidfuzz import process

suggestion = process.extractOne("Brizban", known_cities)[0]
```
