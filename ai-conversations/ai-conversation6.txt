Conversation about exploring implementation options for the WeatherWise app

Me: I have to create a weather app in Python for an assignment. There are three suggested options: 
1. Dashboard with charts, 
2. Chatbot-style interface, or 
3. A hybrid of both. What are the trade-offs of each?

AI: Here's a breakdown of the three options:
- **Option 1: Dashboard only**: Better for visual learners, allows data comparisons, but less natural interaction.
- **Option 2: Chatbot only**: More conversational and accessible, but harder to use for visual comparisons.
- **Option 3: Hybrid**: Offers flexibility but takes more effort to integrate both components.

Me: Which of these would show more technical depth for a final project?

AI: The hybrid approach typically demonstrates broader skills:
- Modular code design
- Visualisation and NLP integration
- User interaction patterns
It aligns well with real-world apps and satisfies a wider range of learning objectives.
